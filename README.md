# ðŸ“Š Sales Performance Dashboard

A **multi-tool project** demonstrating the full workflow of building a sales performance dashboard â€” starting with **SQL queries**, moving through **Python analysis**, and finally producing dashboards in both **Excel** and **Power BI**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Part 1: SQL â€” Data Retrieval & Cleaning

**Goal:** Extract and clean sales data from a relational database.

**Key Tasks:**
1. **Basic Queries**
   - Count total number of orders.
   - Find distinct product categories sold.
   - Identify top 10 customers by total spend.
2. **Aggregations**
   - Calculate monthly revenue.
   - Find average order value (AOV).
   - Generate region-wise sales breakdown.
3. **Joins** *(if additional tables like `products` or `customers` are used)*  
   - List customer names with their total revenue.
   - Find top 5 products by revenue in each region.
4. **Export**
   - Save cleaned outputs as **SQL views** or export to **CSV** for downstream analysis.

## ðŸ”¹ Part 2: Python â€” Analysis & Automation

**Goal:** Use Python for deeper analysis and automated data preparation.

**Key Tasks:**
1. **Database Connection**  
   Connect with `pandas` + `sqlalchemy` and run SQL queries directly in Python.
2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values.  
   - Convert dates to `datetime`.  
   - Calculate total revenue per order (`quantity * price`).  
3. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Monthly revenue trend (line chart).  
   - Revenue contribution by region (bar chart).  
   - Top 10 products by sales (bar chart).  
4. **Advanced Analysis (Optional)**  
   - Customer segmentation (loyal vs. one-time buyers).  
   - Forecast next monthâ€™s sales using a simple moving average.  
5. **Export**  
   Save the cleaned and aggregated dataset into **Excel** for dashboarding.

## ðŸ”¹ Part 3: Excel â€” Visualization & Dashboard

**Goal:** Build an interactive, stakeholder-friendly dashboard.

**Key Tasks:**
1. Import the processed Excel file from Python.  
2. Create pivot tables for:  
   - Monthly sales trend.  
   - Sales by region.  
   - Top 5 products.  
3. Build visualizations:  
   - Line chart for revenue trend.  
   - Bar chart for products/regions.  
   - Pie chart for region share.  
4. Add interactive **slicers & filters** (year, region, product category).  
5. Design a neat **dashboard sheet** suitable for managers/executives.

## ðŸ”¹ Part 4: Power BI â€” End-to-End Solution

**Goal:** Replicate the entire workflow in Power BI for a modern BI environment.  

**Key Tasks:**
1. **Data Import & Cleaning**  
   - Connect to raw sales dataset directly in Power BI.  
   - Clean and transform using **Power Query (M language)**.  
   - Calculate measures with **DAX** (e.g., revenue, AOV, region-wise sales).  
2. **Visualizations**  
   - Monthly sales trend (line chart).  
   - Sales by region (map & bar chart).  
   - Top products (bar chart).  
   - Customer breakdown.  
3. **Interactive Features**  
   - Add slicers for time, region, and product category.  
   - Drill-through reports for detailed customer/product insights.  
4. **Dashboard Design**  
   - Professional, interactive dashboard replicating Excelâ€™s insights in a **dynamic Power BI report**.
